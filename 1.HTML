    <p>Cauliflower is ready to harvest when the white head is around 15-20cm. Keep outer leaves on the plant to protect the head from the sun. Harvest the cauliflower by cutting the head off the plant a few inches from the base.</p>
    <p>The cauliflower head may turn purple or pink if it is exposed to too much heat, cold, or sunlight. This will not change the flavour though so you can still harvest and enjoy it!</p>

    <p>Cucumber plants can get quite large, so make sure you grow them on the bottom levels.</p>
    <p>Cucumbers grown using aeroponics in the Airgarden are best harvested at 10 - 15cm. It is normal for the first few fruits to die off so fear not - as long as the plant continues to produce new, healthy growth then the it just needs more time to grow to a mature state.</p>

    <p>To hand pollinate: Go to your plant early (before 10am), carefully pluck male flower (the one that is long with no swollen ovary at the back of the flower) peel back petals to expose pollen anthers in center, and gently brush against center of female flower (shorter stem and mini fruit behind the flower with larger petals).

    <p>Eggplants should be harvested when they are 10-20cm, when they have reached a rich purple colour. Their colour will begin to fade and if left un-harvested for too long they will turn yellow and overripe.</p>
    <p>Eggplants love pruning and harvesting – doing both regularly will spur more and faster growth. The plant will grow too tall and risk restricting other plants unless clipped when it reaches around 40cm. </p>

    <p>Harvest leaves at 10-15cm for milder flavor, or leave to grow larger for a more intense peppery flavour. Watch out for bolting, as this makes the leaves fibrous and astringent. You will know your rocket plant is at the end of its lifecycle once it starts to taste bitter.</p>

    <p>Pruning also ensures nutrients are funelled to your actual fruits (not the leaves), and that they can access maximum sunlight.</p>

    <p>Harvest zucchinis when they have reached 15-20cm by gently twisting off or cutting at stem halfway between fruit and plant.</p>
    <p>Be careful not to scratch flesh as zucchini will not keep as well. Pluck off any immature fruits that are turning yellow or withering at the flower end as this indicates poor pollination which is necessary for full fruit formation.</p>
    <p>If you don't have any natural pollinators around, you may need to <span style="color: #1c6f47;"><a style="color: #1c6f47;" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=hand+pollinating&amp;oq=hand+pollinating&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0i512l9.4639j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener" previewlistener="true">hand-pollinate</a></span> to ensure you plant actually produces ediable fruits.</p>
    <p>To hand pollinate: Go to your plant early (before 10am), carefully pluck male flower (the one that is long with no swollen ovary at the back of the flower) peel back petals to expose pollen anthers in center, and gently brush against center of female flower (shorter stem and mini fruit behind the flower with larger petals). You can also use a paint brush to do this.</p>
